    # 👨‍💻 My Journey in Cloud & Crypto Technologies
    
    Hello, I am Mao Jie aka M J. Welcome to my interactive portfolio showcasing my educational journey and knowledge/experience 
    in cloud architecture, fintech, and cryptocurrency technologies. This dashboard reflects my passion for gamification at the intersection of cloud computing and digital finance—have fun exploring the widgets, and I hope you learn something useful.
    
    ## 🎓 Educational Foundation
    
    My journey began with a strong technical foundation in computer science, enhanced by 
    specialized certifications and continuous learning in:
    - **Cloud** — Go-to-market leader with deep technical expertise who drove product launches that captured 30% additional market share within 6 months, developed scalable enablement programs that reduced onboarding time by 40%, and expanded cloud developer ecosystems through community initiatives that boosted engagement by 30%. Hold current certifications as Google Cloud Digital Leader (2024) and AWS Cloud Practitioner (2025), with hands-on experience in BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, and Amazon S3
    - **Fintech & Web3** - Combined advanced academic foundation in Financial Technology & Analytics (SMU) with practical developer advocacy experience at Google Cloud to execute Web3 go-to-market strategies. Successfully scaled Layer-2 blockchain adoption, guided 20+ startups through structured hackathons and bootcamps, and achieved 40% improvement in post-program Cloud platform activation across the Web3 developer community.
    - **Cybersecurity** - Applied comprehensive cybersecurity laboratory experience across symmetric/asymmetric encryption, buffer overflow analysis, password hashing protocols, and penetration testing methodologies. Aligned technical capabilities with enterprise security frameworks including NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001 standards to architect secure-by-design solutions for fintech and Web3 applications.
    
    
    ## 🚀 What This Dashboard Demonstrates
    
    This interactive platform showcases:
    - **Real-world problem solving** through cloud architecture scenarios
    - **Live market integration** with cryptocurrency APIs
    - **Cost modeling** and optimization strategies
    - **Security-first design** with compliance awareness
    
    ---
    
    **Explore the dashboard** to see my technical capabilities in action through interactive 
    demos and real-time data integration.
